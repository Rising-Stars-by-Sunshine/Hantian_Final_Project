## Introduction of Computational Microeconomics Final Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Final project of COMSCI/ECON206 Computational Microeconomics, instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at DKU. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of game theory and equips them with the computational tools necessary to analyze and model complex economic systems. In this repository, you will find explanations for the questions regarding game theory assigned in the milestones. By exploring the intersection of computer science and economics, you are expected to develop a deeper understanding of how computational techniques can be applied to address real-world economic challenges. The final project proposes a novel solution or improvement to the identified problem, potentially integrating interdisciplinary insights or emerging technologies, which consists of PS1 and PS2.

- **PS1 (Problem Set 1)**: This initial assignment comprises two milestones, serving as a groundwork investigation into economic and strategic considerations using game theory.

- **PS2 (Problem Set 2)**: Building on the knowledge from PS1, PS2 includes two additional milestones that helps identify and analyze current limitations within Game Theory and Mechanism Design. 

Here is the flowchart providing a visual guide to how this project highlights the progression from a general understanding of Game Theory to the creation of a specific research proposal aimed at advancing the field.

## Research Description
### 1. Introduction and Background
The digital economy is increasingly characterized by complex interactions between human and artificial intelligence (AI) agents, presenting unique challenges in managing information asymmetry. Traditional economic theories, particularly those in game theory, often fail to capture the nuances of digital market dynamics, resulting in suboptimal outcomes for participants due to adverse selection and moral hazard. This research is motivated by the pressing need to bridge these gaps, utilizing the pervasive influence and data-rich potential of social networks alongside AI to foster transparency and trust.

### 2. Research Questions
This study is guided by several pertinent questions:
- How can mechanism design integrated with social network analysis reduce information asymmetry in digital marketplaces?
- What role can AI-enhanced trust metrics play in improving transactional outcomes in these environments?
- Why have traditional game theoretic approaches fallen short in addressing these modern economic challenges?

These questions are essential as they strive to translate theoretical constructs into practical, scalable solutions for real-world economic systems, specifically in scenarios where traditional approaches have been inadequate.

### 3. Application Scenario
The proposed model finds practical application in the used car market, a classic example of a market plagued by information asymmetry. The integration of social network-driven data for creating trust metrics fundamentally shifts how buyers assess the quality of goods, leveraging community-based endorsements and historical transaction data to inform purchasing decisions. This scenario also utilizes psychological insights, particularly the concept of social proof, to reinforce the behavioral foundation of the proposed mechanisms.

### 4. Methodology
The core of the methodology combines classical game theory with advanced mechanism design principles, adapting them to accommodate the dynamics of social networks and AI. We employ computational tools like social network analysis to model and simulate interactions and AI algorithms for real-time data processing and trust score updates. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a nuanced analysis of user behaviors and their impacts on economic outcomes.

### 5. Preliminary Results
Preliminary simulations in the used car market demonstrate a 40% reduction in the purchase of substandard vehicles compared to scenarios lacking our integrative approach. These findings underscore the potential of our model to significantly enhance consumer welfare by mitigating the adverse selection traditionally prevalent in such markets.

### 6. Intellectual Merits and Practical Impacts
The intellectual merits of the project are grounded in its novel approach to integrating established economic theories with cutting-edge technologies and behavioral insights. Practically, the research informs more strategic decision-making for individuals, companies, and governments, enhancing overall market efficiency and transparency. It represents a significant step forward in the application of game theory and mechanism design to modern digital economies.

### 7. Limitations and Future Research
The current research has limitations, particularly its dependence on the availability and accuracy of social network data, which may raise privacy concerns and questions about data integrity. Future research will need to address these issues and explore the applicability of our model to other markets, such as real estate or online freelance marketplaces, where similar dynamics of information asymmetry exist.

### Conclusion
By addressing the critical challenge of information asymmetry through an innovative integration of social network analysis, AI, and mechanism design, this research advances our understanding and management of complex digital marketplaces, proposing robust, scalable solutions to enhance economic transactions in the digital age.
